.Applying a Firewall Rule-Set to an Interface
* Once a rule-set is created, it can be applied to an interface. Note only one rule-set can be applied to each interface for in, out, or local traffic for each protocol (IPv4 and IPv6).
* I.e.: `set interfaces ethernet eth1 firewall out name INSIDE-OUT`
** Applies the firewall rule INSIDE-OUT to all forwarded packets outbound from eth1
* A Rule-Set can be appliend to every inteface:
** in: Ruleset for forwarded packets on inbound interface
** out: Ruleset for forwarded packets on outbound interface
** local: Ruleset for packets destined for this router

----
set firewall name OUTSIDE-IN default-action 'drop'
set firewall name OUTSIDE-IN description 'deny traffic from internet'
----
`set interfaces ethernet eth0 firewall in name 'OUTSIDE-IN'`


* Seems to allow SSH and pings from the local subnet:
----
set firewall name OUTSIDE-LOCAL default-action 'drop'
set firewall name OUTSIDE-LOCAL rule 310 source group address-group SSH-ACCESS
set firewall name OUTSIDE-LOCAL rule 310 action 'accept'
set firewall name OUTSIDE-LOCAL rule 310 destination port '22'
set firewall name OUTSIDE-LOCAL rule 310 protocol 'tcp'
set firewall name OUTSIDE-LOCAL rule 900 action 'accept'
set firewall name OUTSIDE-LOCAL rule 900 description 'allow icmp'
set firewall name OUTSIDE-LOCAL rule 900 protocol 'icmp'
----
`set interfaces ethernet eth0 firewall local name 'OUTSIDE-LOCAL'`
